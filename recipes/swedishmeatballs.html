    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F(175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet
        with aluminium foil; place a baking rack on top. Coat the baking rack
        with cooking spray.
      </li>
      <li>
        Combine bread crumbs and milk in a large bowl until bread crumbs soak up
        the milk, about 10 minutes
      </li>
      <li>
        Mix in ground beef, ground pork, onion, parsley, celery, egg, garlic,
        sugar, salt, and pepper until combined; mixture will be fairly wet.
      </li>
      <li>
        Form into roughly 36 meatballs with a 1-tablerspoon cookie scoop; place
        on the prepared baking rack.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated over until an instant-read thermometer inserted
        into the centers of the meatballs reads 160 degrees F(71 degrees C),
        about 18 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, melt butter in a large saucepan over medium-low heat. Whisk
        in flour; cooking and stirring constantly, for 2 minutes. Gradually
        whisk in beef broth, and Worcestershire sauce until smooth; cook and
        stir until slightly thickened, about 12 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add meatballs to sauce; simmer 3 minutes. Stir in sour cream, dill, and
        lemon zest; season with salt pepper.
      </li>
      <li>Serve, and enjoy!</li>
