    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      French toast is certainly an all time favorite comfort food, and a perfect
      way to start the day! <br />
      Fluffy, and full of protein, smother it in syrup or peanut butter, or load
      it up with your favorite fresh fruit!
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2/3 cup of milk</li>
      <li>2 large eggs</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
      <li>salt to taste</li>
      <li>6 thick slices of bread (brioche is best)</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Gather all ingredients</li>
      <li>
        Whisk milk, eggs, vanilla, cinnomon, and salt together in a shallow bowl
        until combined and smooth.
      </li>
      <li>
        Lightly butter a griddle or skillet and heat over medium-high heat. Soak
        each slice of bread in eggy mixture for about 5 to 10 seconds per side.
        This allows it to absorb the mixture without becoming overly soggy.
      </li>
      <li>
        Transfer to the hot skillet. Cook until golden brown and slightly crisp,
        3-4 minutes per side.
      </li>
      <li>Serve hot, add your favorite toppings, and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
